# Final Thoughts

This was a fairly challenging assignement. The test took me around 5 days to complete. 

Improvements to be made:

* Having already taken user
  - creating a function which handles duplicate email adresses

  - creating a function which handles duplicate usernames

* Tesing 
    - because I had used an icon from the stars, I found it challenging do test whether the color is blue or gray
    - created Snapshot testing for a even more roadbust test

* Could have used a user authentication (firebase)
    - could have used user authentication with firebase
    - it would have meant that user authentication (like having a same email) would be handled

Reasons for choosing design:

* Keep it proffesional and keeping user engaged
    - making sure that the user feels like they can trust the form, ensuring it keeps the user engaged.

    - choosing the design allowed errors to be shown clearly

* Simplisity
    - chose not to include labels for inputs, as its very clear what the input is with the placeholder

    - chose two main colors to keep it clean and visually apealing. Making sure it follows a color scheme close to checkout.com

Reasons for using redux as state management:

* Why?
    - hides the heavy logic with abstraction
    - providing global state  
    - allows me to use state in another component
    - easily readable
    -easily maintainable
